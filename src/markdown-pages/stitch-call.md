As part of IC Hack 2020, our team created a non-conventional video chat platform to bring people who are in separate places, even closer together.

Stitch Call uses real-time image segmentation to put video chat users together in the same screen and environment. We also integrated a few interactive games that make use of emotion detection, to make the hangout even more exciting.
