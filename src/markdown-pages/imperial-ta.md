During my third year I was selected to be a Teaching Assistant in Programming for first year students. 

Responsibilities included learning weekly tutorials for 8 first year undergraduate students, with a focus on teaching key programming concepts. We introduced good software engineering practices through grading and giving constructive feedback on weekly Haskell and Java programming exercises.
