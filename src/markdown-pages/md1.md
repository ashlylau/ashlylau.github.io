When we are travelling or living far away from friends or loved ones, sometimes we just want to imagine being in the same space as them. What if we can play a game in the same 'space' as them, create a combined happy birthday video, or even film a vlog together remotely?

We have built a non-conventional video chatting platform to bring the other person to your space. You are able to talk with each other like just any other regular video chatting platform, but you get to see both of you together in the same screen/environment! We also integrated a few interactive games to make the hangout a bit more exciting.
