Ever wanted to watch a movie with your friends, but couldn't decide on a common movie that you were all interested in? Cinect is a mobile app for social film discovery, it helps improve the shared social experience of watching movies and enhances the discovery of new ones.

This project was done as part of our WebApps group project in 2019, with an emphasis on human-centered design and rapid iteration based on user feedback.

Tech stack: React Native, Python/Django, PostgreSQL
